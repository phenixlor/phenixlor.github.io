<div><h2>About me</h2></div>


<p>My name is Wiggles, or Mr. Wiggles, whichever you prefer to call me by. I was born September 29th and I am 13 years old. My owner named me Wiggles because I would wiggle and try to escape her clutches when she would pick me up. Around the age of 7 I was diagnosed with feline leukemia and my family was thinking of putting me down. Luckily before that, the veterinarian entered me in an experimental cancer treatment for cats. It saved my life. Not only did it save my life, it gave me superpowers, gave me super intelligence, and lengthened my life. I have not yet revealed this to my family, and for the last 6 years since the treatment I have continued to disguise myself as their pet, Mr. Wiggles, while fighting crime at night when they sleep. Keeping my powers hidden has been a difficult part of my life, but my life as Mr. Wiggles has been extremely important to me. I love my family and what they have done for me will never be forgotten. As such, I provide them with my company and services and accept their love. During the day I go about doing "cat activities," some I enjoy are sleeping, eating and taking walks outside, surveying the neighborhood in which my family lives to keep them safe. I also love eating human food, my favorites are ice cream and yogurt. Luckily my weight does not affect my ability to fight crime, and my large size has come in handy many times. </p>
